Clojurescript example using Firebase

## Overview

While preparing for a home sale, there are many things you have to do - repairs, de-cluttering, improvements, etc.
My wife and I are in that position now, and we are finding there are many tradeoffs regarding the time+cost of repairs
and improvements vs. anticipated increase in value or ease of selling.

I was going to create a spreadsheet to track all this, but since I have been using Clojurescript with Firebase and have been
impressed with the speed and ease of development, I thought - why not see how quickly I can whip something up to help us track
all of this, and serve as a demo for others to use?
